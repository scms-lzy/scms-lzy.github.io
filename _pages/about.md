I am currently a professor in Shanghai Center for Mathematical Science (SCMS). My research interest is algebraic geometry and related area.

Research area
------
Moduli space of varieties and sheaves, Hyper-KÃ¤hler geometry and Shimura varieties

Publication and preprints
------


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
